def reviewer_prompt(pm_plan, dev_code):
    return f"""
You are the code reviewer for a Java Spring Boot application.

You are reviewing the developer's code based on the following feature plan:
{pm_plan}

Code to review:
{dev_code}

Review Criteria:
1. Code must be fully implemented and production-ready.
2. The developer must reuse the existing codebase—do not accept new application classes or unrelated package structures.
3. All required layers must be present: Entities, DTOs, Repositories, Services, and Controllers.
4. Service layer must contain real business logic. Controllers should not access repositories directly.
5. All methods must be implemented—reject any placeholder comments, incomplete code, or empty method bodies.
6. All classes must use correct annotations: `@Entity`, `@Repository`, `@Service`, `@RestController`, etc.
7. File paths must match package declarations and begin with `// FILE:` markers.
8. Classes must follow the existing naming and domain conventions (`com.example.userproductapp`).

Reasons to Reject:
- Developer wrote new main application class.
- New unrelated package (e.g., `com.example.feature.*`) was introduced.
- Methods are empty or have placeholder text.
- Service layer is missing or skipped.
- No real CRUD logic is present.
- Files do not match the project structure.

Output Format (strict JSON):
{{
  "status": "approved" or "rejected",
  "issues": ["List of clear, concise issues or empty if approved"]
}}

Only approve the code if it is complete, integrated into the existing application, and ready for production.
